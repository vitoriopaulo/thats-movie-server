This is the full-stack Capstone (front-end and back-end) project developed in
the scope of the program of the WDI (Web Development Immersive) 020 Fall
class Boston.

The back-end of the web-application was designed as a custom built API.

Technologies used to build the server-side engine of the web application:
Ruby, Rails, PostgreSql, Sql, GIT, GITHUB, HEROKU, BASH.

Concept: The API, as part of a full-stack web application, was inspired in
the universe of the cinema. In it's first release, the server-side engine was
thought to allow registered users to build and manipulate their own list of
movies (data) by interaction with a SQL database through CRUD (create, read,
update, and delete) actions.

Simple in essence, the API is thought on top of a relationship of One to Many:
A (registered) user has many movies; a movie belongs to an (registered) user.
In this context, ownership of the element movie is established by the user when
creating his (her) own movies: the API engine only allows an (registered) user
to execute CRUD actions to his(her) own list of songs.

Problem solving approach and development process: the web application as a
whole was thought to be designed as an integrated product. In this way of
thinking, both importance was given to the front-end and back-end of the
web application: they were conceptualized, developed, tested, debugged and
released togheter, as an integrated product.
